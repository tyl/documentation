## Zoom and DrillDown Fields

A zoom field is a selection field with the same objective as a ComboBox, but with extended capabilities. When the user clicks the zoom button (the magnifying glass), instead of a menu, a popup window is shown. Users may select an item from the popup window. 

A DrillDown Field is just ZoomField where selection is forbidden. It is purely a view over a container. A DrillDown can be tell apart from a Zoom field, because the drilldown button is an ellipsis (â‹¯) instead of a magnifying glass.

**TIP** A ZoomField behaves automatically as a DrillDown when it is set to read-only, and its button turns into an ellipsis.

### Example

Suppose you have a collection of `Person` objects, and that each object has a `Role` field

```java
public class Role {
	String name;
	...
}
```

You may build a Zoom field to select the role for each person. The Zoom field will open a table view that shows all the details of a `Role` collection. The collecton of roles should be accessible through a `container` (if it is a simple collection, you may use a `ListContainer`).

```java
final Container.Indexed mainContainer = ... ;
final FieldBinder<Person> fieldBinder = 
       new FieldBinder<Person>(Person.class, mainContainer).withDefaultBehavior();

final Container.Indexed zoomContainer = ... ;
final TextZoomField zoomField = 
       fieldBinder.buildZoomField(
            "role", "name", zoomContainer);
```


The auto-generated ZoomField is already pre-configured with a default `ZoomDialog` implementation. The default is to use a Vaadin table, but Grid support is already baked in.


ZoomFields can be instanced manually with: 
```java
final TextZoomField zoomField = new TextZoomField()
``` 



In this case the `ZoomDialog` has to be given explicitly:

```java
final ZoomDialog zoomDialog = /* instance of a zoomDialog impl. */ ; 
final TextZoomField zoomField = new TextZoomField();
zoomField.withZoomDialog(zoomDialog);
```


Available ZoomDialog implementations are `TableZoomDialog` and `GridZoomDialog`:

```java
final ZoomDialog zd1 = new TableZoomDialog(propertyId, zoomContainer);
final ZoomDialog zd2 = new GridZoomDialog(propertyId, zoomContainer);
```

The GridZoomDialog requires Vaadin 7.4+ and it supports extra filtering capabilities.

Users may supply their own implementation of the `ZoomDialog` interface.




## DrillDown Fields

DrillDown fields can be built the same way as ZoomFields by way of a FieldBinder, except the method is `buildDrillDownField()`:

```java
final Container.Indexed zoomContainer = ... ;
final TextZoomField drillDownField = 
       fieldBinder.buildDrillDownField(
            "role", "name", zoomContainer);
```

Notice that the type of the field is still `TextZoomField` because the `DrillDown` is implemented as an option of a `TextZoomField`. 

In case you are creating a new instance manually, the DrillDown behavior can be obtained through the API call:

```java
zoomField.drillDownOnly();
```

which can be chained for brevity:
```java
final TextZoomField drillDownField = 
      new TextZoomField()
      .withZoomDialog(...)
      .drillDownOnly();
```
